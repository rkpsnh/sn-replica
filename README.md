Remember that this is just an initial set of tasks and stories for your ServiceNow replica PoC. You may need to break these down further into smaller subtasks, estimate the time required for each, and prioritize them based on your project's timeline and goals. Additionally, you may want to involve relevant stakeholders and iterate on the requirements as the project progresses.
